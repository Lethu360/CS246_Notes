<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Students are expected to have the following background:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to write very non-trivial computer programs (at a minimum, at the level of CS107).</li>
  <li>Good knowledge of Java will be extremely helpful since most assignments will require the use of Hadoop which is written in Java.</li>
  <li>Familiarity with basic probability theory is essential (at a minimum, at the level of CS109 or Stat116). </li>
  <li>Familiarity with writing rigorous proofs (at a minimum, at the level of CS 103).</li>
  <li>Familiarity with basic linear algebra (e.g., any of Math 51, Math 103, Math 113, CS 205, or EE 263 would be much more than necessary).</li>
  <li>Familiarity with algorithmic analysis (e.g., CS 161 would be much more than necessary).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#meetingtime">recitation sessions</a> in the first weeks of the class will give the overview of the expected background.</p>


<h3>Course materials</h3>

<p> Lecture notes and slides will be posted on-line. Readings have been derived from the book <a href="http://mmds.org">Mining of Massive Datasets</a> by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman.</p>

<p>You can see earlier versions of the notes and slides for the
<a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-2014">Winter 2014</a> version of the course. Note there may be a slight change in the topics covered this year.</p>

<p>Course handouts and other reading materials can be <a href="handouts.html">downloaded here</a>.</p>

<h3>Course work and grading</h3>
<p>The coursework for the course will consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gradiance quizzes: Short weekly Gradiance quizzes. 20% of the final grade.</li>
  <li>Homeworks: Four biweekly homeworks that include programming. 40% of the final grade.</li>
  <li>Final exam. 40% of the final grade</li>
</ul>


<h3>Gradiance quizzes</h3>

<p>With regard to the weekly quizzes on Gradiance. Here are the instructions:
<ul>
  <li> Go to <a href="http://www.newgradiance.com/services">http://www.newgradiance.com/services</a></li>
  <li> Register and use the class token B343F7F0 </li>
  <li> <b>Make sure you register using your Stanford email (SUNet ID) so we can match enrollment records</b></li>
  <li> There is a MapReduce quiz already assigned (see under the Homeworks tab) with 4 quick questions. </li>
  <li> To answer some of them you will need access to the <a href="http://mmds.org">Mining Massive Datasets</a> book
  <li> You will have exactly 1 week to complete the quiz. <b>(There are no late days!)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>You can try the work as many times as you like, and we hope everyone will eventually get 100%. The secret is that each of the questions involves a "long-answer" problem, which you should work. The Gradiance system gives you random right and wrong answers each time you open it, and thus samples your knowledge of the full problem. While there are ways to game the system, we group several questions at a time, so it is hard to get 100% without actually working the problems. Also notice that you have to wait 10 minutes between openings, so brute-force random guessing will not work.</p>

<p>Solutions appear after the problem-set is due. However, you must submit at least once, so your most recent solution appears with the solutions embedded.</p>

<p>Gradiance quizzes are generally out on Friday afternoon and due <b>exactly</b> a week later (Friday 11:59pm Pacific time). Note that we cannot under any circumstances extend the quiz deadline. Once the deadline has passed students will not be able to submit their quizzes.</p>

<h3>Homeworks</h3>

<p>Four biweekly homeworks that will involve programming, working with Hadoop, as well as regular numerical/algebraic theory problems. </p>

<p><b><u>Questions:</u></b> We try very hard to make questions unambiguous, but some ambiguities may remain. Ask (i.e., post a question on <a href="https://piazza.com/class#winter2015/cs246">Piazza</a>) if confused or state your assumptions explicitly. Reasonable assumptions will be accepted in case of ambiguous questions.</p>

<p><b><u>Honor code:</u></b> We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the  code and solutions independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself. In addition, each student should write on the problem set the set of people with whom she/he interacted.</p>

<p>Since we occasionally reuse problem set questions from previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers. It is an <b>honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions</b>. This applies both to the official solutions and to solutions that you or someone else may have written up in a previous year.</p>

<p>Finally, we consider it an Honor Code Violation to post your homework solutions to a place where it is easy for other students to access it. This includes uploading your solutions to publicly-viewable repositories like on GitHub.</p>

<p>The standard penalty for a first offense includes a one-quarter suspension from the University and 40 hours of community service. And the standard penalty for multiple violations (e.g. cheating more than once in the same course) is a three-quarter suspension and 40 or more hours of community service. <a href="https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/communitystandards/integrity/honor-interpretations">Stanford Office of community standards</a> has more information.</p>

<p><b><u>Late assignments:</u></b> Each student will have a total of <b>two late periods</b> to use for homeworks, reaction papers and project proposals. <b>One late period expires at the start of every class.</b> (This means that if the assignment is due on Thursday then the first late period expires on the following Tuesday.) Once late periods are exhausted, any assignments turned in late will be penalized 50% per late period. However, no assignment will be accepted more than <b>one late period after its due date.</b></p>

<p><b><u>Assignment submission:</u></b> See the <a href="faq.html">F.A.Q.</a></p>

<p><b><u>Regrade policy:</u></b> We take great care to ensure that grading is fair and consistent. Since we will always use the same grading procedure, any grades you receive are unlikely to change significantly. However, if you feel that your work deserves a regrade, please submit a written request within a week of receiving your grade. In your request, indicate which components of your submission you would like regraded, and prepare a clear and concise argument why you feel we should regrade those components.</p>

<p>Regrades should be mailed to the course staff mailing list.</p>

<p>However, note that we reserve the right to regrade the entire assignment. Moreover, if the regrade request is unjustified and thus not honored, then every future unsuccessful regrade request will be penalized 5 points.</p>

<!--Regrade Policy
As your TAs and instructor we make an effort to try to ensure fair and consistent grades. It is not inconceivable, though, that we may have made a mistake when grading your assignments/exams/etc. We will entertain regrade requests with the following stipulations:
Address your concerns first to the TAs (preferably to the TA responsible for the grade in question) before bringing the issue to the professor.
Regrade requests will only be entertained during office hours or by special appointment (i.e. not during or after class).
Before requesting a regrade, please prepare a clear and concise argument for your stance by doing the following:
re-read relevant sections of papers, the notes, and the text (where applicable).
read carefully the comments we provide on your work and consider their meaning
We reserve the right to regrade the entirety of any assignment/test for which any regrade is requested.
-->


<a name="VM"></a>

<h3>Hadoop in a Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>Most assignments will require some level of programming in <a href"http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>. Hadoop is the open source implementation of MapReduce distributed data processing environment for mining large data sets across clusters of computers.</p>

<p>You will be running Hadoop jobs on your local laptop/desktop. However, since installing and setting up Hadoop is non-trivial we prepared a Linux virtual machine with Hadoop already installed.
We will post the instructions and the VM soon.
</p> 

<h3>Recitation sessions</h3>

<p>Two recitation sessions will be held:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linear Algebra Review: properties such as rank and nullspace, operations such as inverse and trace, quadratic forms, eigendecomposition.</li>
  <li>Probability Review: random variables, moments, basic limits and bounds, maximum likelihood, basic optimization algorithms like gradient descent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recitation sessions are only intended to be refreshers; it is expected that you have already taken courses that include this material.</p>


<!--<p>Here are the instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download and complete <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-data/hw0.pdf">Assignment 0</a>. The Assignment which will guide you through the setup process</li>
<li>Download the virtual image: <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-data/cs246.vdi">cs246.vdi</a> / <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-data/cs246.ova">cs246.ova</a>. Try importing VDI file first. If it does not work try OVA.</li>
</ul>-->

<h3>Previous versions of the course</h3>

<p>The previous version of the course is <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs345a/">CS345A: Data Mining</a> which also included a course project. CS345A has now been split into two courses CS246 (Winter, 3 Units, homeworks, final, no project) and CS341 (Spring, 3 Units, project focused).</p>

<p>CS246 was first offered in Winter 2011. <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-2011">Here</a> is the course webpage with all the materials.</p>
